Database Management Systems
----------------------------
DBMS provides an environment for storage, retrieval and processing of the data effectively.


Database Management System is a software that is used to create, maintain and 
provide controled access to user databses.

Database Management systems should provide systematic method of
	-> creating the database
	-> updating the database
	-> Storing the database
	-> Retrieving the data from database
	-> Mainting different levels of security

Expected features of DBMS software
----------------------------------

1. Enable end user and application programmers to share the data.
2. Enable data shared among multiple applicaiton.
3. Should not propagate and store data in new files for every new 
   application.
4. Should provide facilty for
	a. controlling data access
	b. enforce data integrity
	c. manage concurrency control
	d. restoring the data in system failure.


Evolution of DBMS
-----------------

It is introduced in 1960's
relational model first defined by E.F Codd (IBM) in 1970.

Here, are the important landmarks from the history:

    1960 – Charles Bachman designed first DBMS system
    1970 – Codd introduced IBM’S Information Management System (IMS)
    1976- Peter Chen coined and defined the Entity-relationship model also know as the ER model
    1980 – Relational Model becomes a widely accepted database component
    1985- Object-oriented DBMS develops.
    1990s- Incorporation of object-orientation in relational DBMS.
    1991- Microsoft ships MS access, a personal DBMS and that displaces all other personal DBMS products.
    1995: First Internet database applications
    1997: XML applied to database processing. Many vendors begin to integrate XML into DBMS products.


DBMS
----- 
1. Database Management Systems
2. Multi-user access 	
3. Design to fulfill the need for small and large businesses 	.
4. Remove redundancy and Integrity 	
5. Expensive. But in the long term Total Cost of Ownership is cheap 	
6. Easy to implement complicated transactions 	


Objectives 
----------

1. Reduce the maintenance cost of software.
2. Manage the complex data types.
3. Provide easier and faster access to data even for end user.


Users
-----
1. Application Programmers
2. Database Administrators
3. End Users

Here, is the list of some popular DBMS system

Different Data Models
---------------------
1. Flat file DBMS
2. Hierarchical DBMS
3. Network Data DBMS
4. Relational DBMS
5. Object Relational DBMS

purpose of DataModels
----------------------
communicate, describe, investigate, analyze and categorize.



Database as per Oracle
----------------------

-> As per oracle database is collection of data in one or more number of files.
-> The database is a collection of logical structures and physical structures
   which are integrated and configured for the integrity of the system.



Logical Structures
-------------------

* In design state the system is represented in the form of Entity Relational model.

* In the database state is representation of the actual metadata of the 
  database management system software which will be in the form of tablespaces,
  data dictionary objects etc.,



Physical Structures
-------------------

1. In this the system is represented in the form of tables, indexes etc.,
2. Database should have the ability to provide access to external tables for
   files outside the database, as if the rows in the files were rows in the 
   table.
3. Creating structures( Tables and Indexes)
4. With in the oracle database, the basic structure is a table used to store data.



Understanding the oracle sytle for the data storage
----------------------------------------------------

-> All the logical structures in the datbase must be stored with in the database only
-> Oracle maintains a data dictionary, which records metadata about all the
   database objects.
-> The database objects which need physical storages space on the comuter 
   system, are allocated space within the tablespace.


Table Space
-----------

-> It is logical storage unit within oracle database and is not visible in the filesystem
   of the machine on which the database resides.

-> The table space builds the bridge betweeen the oracle database and the file system in
   which the table's or index data is stored.

-> A data file can be part of one and only one table space.

-> There are three types of table spaces in oracle
	1. permanent table space.
	2. undo table space.
	3. temporary table space.

Permanent Tablespace
---------------------
 permanent tablespace contains persistent schema objects, 
 Objects in permanent tablespaces are stored in datafiles.

Undo tablespace
----------------
An undo tablespace is a type of permanent tablespace used by Oracle Database
to manage undo data if you are running your database in automatic undo management mode.

Temporary tablespace
--------------------

A temporary tablespace contains schema objects only for the duration of a session.
Objects in temporary tablespaces are stored in tempfiles.


-> Each table or index stored in an oracle database belongs to a table space.

-> in 10g or later a big file table space can be created, which can grow to the size of Tera Bytes of 
   space in on the disk.

Entity Set

Entity is a physical or logical unit which participates in the application development
in the form attributes

Student(htno,name,branch,m1,m2,m3)

It is discreate in nature.


Information - Processed data is called information


Entity
Entity Set
Super Key

Entity Relation

Types of Relations


a.  one to one  ---> One Entity will be assciated with only one instace of another entity

b.  one to many  --->  

c.  many to many  ---> 

Normalization
-------------
The process of grouping the columns so as to produdce the entity sets which will reduce the 
redundancy and anomolies in the data.

The process of splitting the single redundant table into small consitutent multiple tables without
having the redundacny and anomolies in the data.
