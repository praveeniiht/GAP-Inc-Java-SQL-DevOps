Creating a view
---------------
CREATE [OR REPLACE] VIEW [db_name.]view_name [(column_list)]
AS
  select-statement;

Let us look we have a table orderDetails(orderNumber, productCode, quantityOrdered,priceEach,orderLineNumber)

CREATE VIEW salePerOrder AS
    SELECT 
        orderNumber, 
        SUM(quantityOrdered * priceEach) total
    FROM
        orderDetails
    GROUP by orderNumber
    ORDER BY total DESC;


SELECT * FROM salePerOrder;

Creating a view based on another view example
----------------------------------------------
CREATE VIEW bigSalesOrder AS
    SELECT 
        orderNumber, 
        ROUND(total,2) as total
    FROM
        salePerOrder
    WHERE
        total > 60000;


Creating a view with join example
---------------------------------
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW customerOrders AS
SELECT 
    orderNumber,
    customerName,
    SUM(quantityOrdered * priceEach) total
FROM
    orderDetails
INNER JOIN orders o USING (orderNumber)
INNER JOIN customers USING (customerNumber)
GROUP BY orderNumber;

SELECT * FROM customerOrders ORDER BY total DESC;

Creating a view with a subquery example
---------------------------------------
CREATE VIEW aboveAvgProducts AS
    SELECT 
        productCode, 
        productName, 
        buyPrice
    FROM
        products
    WHERE
        buyPrice > (
            SELECT 
                AVG(buyPrice)
            FROM
                products)
    ORDER BY buyPrice DESC;

SELECT * FROM aboveAvgProducts;
